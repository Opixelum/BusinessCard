# Anto's business card

This project was initially for training my React skills but and the end, I can
use it as a quick overview about me. Moreover, you can find my different
social medias such as my LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub but also my portfolio and my
email.

Since it was a solo project from the FreeCodeCamp React course, I didn't focus
the styling part with CSS (my goal isn't to be a UX designer). So you may have
issues with the landscape mode on mobile but anyway, nobody will look at my
business card in that way.
