          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I'm a 18 years old, 1st year CS student at ESGI in Paris. I've
          discovered my passion for coding at the age of 8. Aside programming,
          I'm evolved in the NFTs space, but also in the crypto currencies
          trading.</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>What drives me is the blockchain technology. I'm actually focusing
          on smart contract development for web 3.0 decentralized apps.
          Moreover, I'm open-minded for working on software/mobile applications
          projects.</p>
